Introduction
============

|testTravisCI| is an open source C/C++ library for compressed numerical arrays that
support high throughput read and write random access.  |testTravisCI| also supports
streaming compression of integer and floating-point data, e.g., for
applications that read and write large data sets to and from disk.

|testTravisCI| was written by `M S <https://www.google.com/>`_
at `Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory <https://www.llnl.gov>`_, and
is loosely based on the :ref:`algorithm <algorithm>` described in the
following paper:

|testTravisCI| was originally designed for testing readthedocs...
